From the Edwardian origins of their fashion to the tabloid fears of delinquency, drunkenness and disorder, the story of the Teds throws a fascinating light on a British society that was still reeling from the Second World War. In the 1950s, working-class teenagers found a way of asserting themselves in how they dressed, spoke and socialised on the street. When people saw Teds, they stepped aside. Musician and author Max D\u00c3\u00a9charn\u00c3\u00a9 traces the rise of the Teds and the shockwave they sent through post-war Britain, from the rise of rock 'n' roll to the Notting Hill race riots.

She hasn't left the village since a traumatic stay in London as a young woman at the end of the 1980s. One of the tourists is Evan, taking an enforced holiday from his family and work in Belfast after breaking down after the death of his daughter in infancy. He has come to try to process his grief and make himself desirable again as a husband, a father and a business partner. But he hasn't been there a week until he gets trapped by lockdown. When Grace saves his life in a kayaking accident - if it was an accident - and Evan's troubled son arrives to stay, all three are drawn together in a way that forces a reckoning with their personal traumas and draws them back into society.

What makes us mistrustful? How can this be overcome?<br/>Daniel Freeman, Professor of Psychology at Oxford, has spent thirty years at the vanguard of paranoia research and treatment. This remarkable and moving book tells the story of that journey.<br/>For decades, conventional wisdom held that paranoia was only experienced by people with severe mental health problems and little could be done to rectify its disastrous effects. Paranoia gives us a front row seat as Freeman turns the traditional view on its head.<br/>He develops life-changing treatments for clinical paranoia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often using state-of-the-art technology like virtual reality. He reveals that suspicion is rife in society, with paranoia widespread, conspiracy theories rampant and emotion all too often trumping evidence. He discovers the causes of mistrust, including the role of genes, trauma, lack of sleep, worry, low self-confidence, cannabis use and hearing voices, and delves into the murky world of Covid-19 conspiracy theories. Lighting up the narrative throughout are the rarely heard voices of people whose lives have been almost wrecked by paranoia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then in many cases transformed by Freeman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s groundbreaking treatments.<br/>This is also a practical book. Freeman shows how we can measure our own levels of mistrust. He explains how we can remedy things if those levels are higher than we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like, because although mistrust can seem engrained, things can change for the better.

As the modernists came of age and the traditionalists began to decline, there arose a rich variety of styles and tastes in Britain and across the empire, a variety that reflected the restless zeitgeist of the years before the Second World War. At the time of his death in 2017, Gavin Stamp, one of Britain's leading architectural critics, was at work on a deeply considered account of British architecture in the interwar period, correcting what he saw as the skewed view of earlier historians who were unable to see past modernism. Beginning with a survey of the modern movement after the armistice, INTERWAR untangles the threads that link lesser-known movements like the Egyptian revival with the enduring popularity of the Tudorbethan, to chronicle one of Britain's most dynamic architectural periods. The result is more than an architectural history - it is the portrait of a changing nation.

Charles Spencer, author of The White Ship<br/>For most of human history, we were rural folk.<br/>Our daily lives were bound up with working the land, living within the rhythm of the seasons. We poured our energies into growing food, tending to animals and watching the weather. Family, friends and neighbours were often one and the same. Life revolved around the village and its key spaces and places \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the church, the green, the school and the marketplace.<br/>And yet rural life is oddly invisible our historical records. The daily routine of the peasant, the farmer or the craftsperson could never compete with the glamour of city life, war and royal drama. Lives went unrecorded, stories untold.<br/>There is, though, one way in which we can learn about our rural past. The things we have left behind provide a connection that no document can match; physical artefacts are touchstones that breathe life into its history. From farming tools to children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toys, domestic objects and strange curios, the everyday items of the past reveal fascinating insights into an often-forgotten way of life.

His ancestors were farmers and farm labourers on the northern island of Sanday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where, in 1624, one of them was murdered by a witch. In an expansive and enthralling historical account, Marshall looks afresh at a small group of islands that has been treated as a mere footnote, remote and peripheral, and in doing so invites us to think differently about key events of British history.<br/>With Orkney as our point of departure, Marshall traverses three dramatic centuries of religious, political and economic upheaval: a time when what we think of as modern Scotland, and then modern Britain, was being forged and tested.<br/>Storm's Edge is a magisterial history, a fascinating cultural study and a mighty attestation to the importance of placing the periphery at the centre. Britain is a nation composed of many different islands, but too often we focus on just one.

Fifteen years later, her teenage granddaughter, Kaitlyn, triggers an international storm of outrage that unleashes the rage of a whole betrayed generation. For one shining fragment of time, the world is with her. But then the backlash begins and soon she and those closest to her find themselves facing the wrath of the old establishment, who will use every dirty trick in the book to fight them off.

Through their conversations he seeks to reconcile the Black and gay narratives of Britain, narratives frequently cleaved as distinct and unrelated.<br/><br/>Tracing these men's journeys and arrivals to South London through the seventies, eighties and nineties from the present day, Okundaye relays their stories with rare compassion, listening as they share intimate memories and reflect upon their lives. They endured and fought against the peak of the AIDS epidemic, built social groups and threw underground parties; they went to war with institutions (and with each other) and created meaning within a society which was often indifferent to their existence.<br/><br/>Revolutionary Acts renders a singular portrait of Britain from the perspective of those buffeted by the winds of marginalisation and discrimination. It is a portrait marked by resilience and self-determination, inspired by the love and beauty Black men have found in each other.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9780571372225", "isbn10": "571372228", "isbn13": "9780571372225", "language": "en", "pages": "304", "publication_year": "2/13/2025", "publisher": "Faber & Faber", "report_code": "", "report_date": "", "rrp": "10.99", "stock": "102", "title": "Revolutionary Acts: Love and Brotherhood in Black Gay Britain", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "250"}, {"id": "459738", "author": "Insight Editions", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/16612563488912.jpg", "description": "Bring your favorite Studio Ghibli characters to life like never before with this all-inclusive origami instruction book, complete with all the paper needed for the projects!<br/><br/>Inspired by Studio Ghibli films such as My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, Ponyo, and more, this deluxe craft book features all-levels, illustrated directions and included origami paper perfect for fans to create beloved characters such as Totoro, Ponyo, Jiji, Calcifer, No-Face, and many more.<br/><br/>NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: Origami-lovers of all skill levels will be able to follow the fully illustrated, step-by-step instructions<br/><br/>PAPER INCLUDED: Create your characters with the included origami sheets in custom colors to match corresponding projects<br/><br/>EXTRAS FOR FANS: With each project, readers are greeted with an image of the studio's film poster and an introductory text highlighting the origami project's featured character, connecting readers even more with the inspiration for these cute paper creations", "discount": "45", "ean": "9798886637304", "isbn10": "", "isbn13": "9798886637304", "language": "en", "pages": "192", "publication_year": "2/4/2025", "publisher": "Insight Editions", "report_code": "", "report_date": "", "rrp": "15.99", "stock": "113", "title": "Studio Ghibli Origami: Unofficial Papercraft Projects to Create Totoro, Ponyo, Jiji, and more!

Written by a northern Scotland specialist who edits the award-winning JRNY Travel Magazine, this guidebook provides greater detail than any other to the whole of northern Scotland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c roaming far beyond the increasingly popular 516-mile North Coast 500 (NC500) driving route. Coupling a wide, personal selection of places to explore with focused advice on travel practicalities, Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s North Highlands (Slow Travel) encourages visitors to adopt a leisurely approach designed to tease out the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special qualities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and contribute positively to local communities.<br/><br/>In the far northern reaches of Scotland, Sutherland, Caithness and Ross-shire are regions that, by their nature, demand to be taken slowly.

Getting into wilderness is joyously easy: within moments of parking your car or stepping out of your B&B, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re striding among scenery so enchanting and dramatic it feels like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been conjured up by someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imagination. Whether you fancy clambering over rocks to discover a secret beach, watching dolphins leap, playing a round at Royal Dornoch Golf Course, kayaking to uninhabited islands or trekking to villages abandoned during the Highland Clearances (the ousted residents often resettling in the US), northern Scotland is the kind of place that gets its teeth into you.

Haunted into adulthood by her Korean father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abandonment of his family, as well as the specter of her beguiling, abusive white mother, the painter finds herself caught in a perfect trap. She wants Hanne, or wants to be her, or to sully her, or destroy her, or consume her, or some confusion of all the above. Since she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an artist, she will use art to get closer to Hanne, beginning a series of paintings with her new muse as model. As for Hanne, what does she want? Her whiteness seems sometimes as cruel as a new sheet of paper.<br/>When the paintings of Hanne become a hit, resulting in the artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sold-out show, she resolves to bring her new muse with her to Berlin, to continue their work, and her seduction. But, just when the painter is on the verge of her long sought-after breakthrough, a petition started by a Black performance artist begins making the rounds in the art community, calling for the boycott of major museums and art galleries for their imperialist and racist practices.<br/>Torn between her desire to support the petition, to be a success, and to possess Hanne, the painter and her reality become more unstable and disorienting, unwilling to cut loose any one of her warring ambitions, yet unable to accommodate them all. Is it any wonder so many artists self-destruct so spectacularly? Is it perhaps just a bit exciting to think she could too?<br/>Your Love Is Not Good stuffs queer explosive into the cracks between identity and aspiration, between desire and art, and revels in the raining debris.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9781916751224", "isbn10": "1916751229", "isbn13": "9781916751224", "language": "en", "pages": "336", "publication_year": "4/15/2025", "publisher": "And Other Stories", "report_code": "", "report_date": "", "rrp": "12.99", "stock": "98", "title": "Your Love is Not Good", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "278"}, {"id": "458858", "author": "Elizabeth Millard", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19907043482458.jpg", "description": "Grow fresh, organic produce in your house, condo, apartment, basement, or sunny downtown office.

The Gutenberg was the first substantial book in Europe to have been printed on a printing press. It represented the democratization of knowledge and was the Holy Grail of rare books.<br/>Was the break-up a sacrilege or a canny deal? New Yorkers were divided. For every frown of disapproval, there was a lick of the lips. It was the Roaring Twenties, the Gatsby era of fabulous wealth.

Wells marketed the pages as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNoble Fragments\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, they sold like hot cakes, and he died a rich man.<br/>Half a century later, Sydney journalist Michael Visontay stumbled upon a mysterious legal document that linked Wells to his own family.

Made with yarn from Iceland, Sweden and Norway, these sweaters are as cosy and warm as traditional Icelandic sweaters but with fresh, bright designs and colours for a brand new look.<br/><br/>Author, Marita Clementz, was inspired to design her bright, colourful sweaters when she couldn't find any knitting patterns that featured the kind of designs she was looking for. She has taken the concept of the traditional Scandinavian sweater and given it a fresh new look by using her own beautiful patterns and colours to make gorgeous sweaters that are as warm and snuggly as the traditional versions but look very contemporary.<br/><br/>The sweaters are all knitted top down and in the round so they can be easily adapted to change the length of the body and arms and there is no seaming to do later. They are designed to have a loose fit which means they work as unisex sweaters and can be worn by the whole family.<br/><br/>Marita uses unspun but not undyed yarn from Norway, Sweden and Iceland to get the same beautiful halo effect, and the same lightness and warmth you get with a traditional lopapeysa sweater.<br/><br/>This collection includes 12 top down sweater designs. Each design has an alternative colourway so you can see how it might look in a different palette and experiment with your own colour choices.<br/><br/>Marita is based in Sweden and as well as knitting she loves to go hiking. This collection of designs has been inspired by nature with its organic shapes and motifs including large flower blooms. The colour choices have also been inspired by the natural world with combinations influenced by the midnight sun in Sweden and midsummer flower meadows.<br/><br/>The sweaters are all graded to fit 10 different sizes and the fit is quite loose so will suit a wide range of body types.

And the stream of their creative admirers and continuators has been constantly widening since the first fans like David Bowie and Iggy Pop: whether Blur, Aphex Twin, Sonic Youth, Radiohead or the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.<br/><br/>In Neu Klang, Christoph Dallach interviews its pioneers, including Irmin Schmidt, Jaki Liebezeit and Holger Czukay of CAN; Neu!'s Michael Rother; Dieter Moebius of Cluster; Klaus Schulze of Tangerine Dream; Karl Bartos of Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and many others.

Campbell's full career is chronicled, from his early influences (Marc Bolan, Rory Gallagher and Gary Moore), his first semi-professional band, Sweet Savage, through to his first real musical break and success with Dio. Followed by a tumultuous breakup with Ronnie James Dio, Campbell toured with Whitesnake on the strength of their multi-platinum selling 1987 album.<br/>In 1992 Campbell started what has become his decades-long relationship with Def Leppard. Campbell's work with Lou Gramm in the band Shadow King, and his time spent with Riverdogs is also explored, all of which helps to shed light on Campbell's evolution from heavy rock 'guitar hero' to a more nuanced player who would rather serve the song with his playing than bring down the house with a 20-minute guitar solo.<br/>Campbell also created Last In Line, basically a rebirth of the Dio band minus it's frontman. In summing up, when Campbell received the Oh Yeah Legend Award in 2017, he said 'I am not used to getting awards. I am not a celebrity, the only people who know me are the hard rock fans and guitar junkies.' The 2017 award marked some belated recognition for Campbell in his hometown.

From the Edwardian origins of their fashion to the tabloid fears of delinquency, drunkenness and disorder, the story of the Teds throws a fascinating light on a British society that was still reeling from the Second World War.

What makes us mistrustful? How can this be overcome?<br/>Daniel Freeman, Professor of Psychology at Oxford, has spent thirty years at the vanguard of paranoia research and treatment. This remarkable and moving book tells the story of that journey.<br/>For decades, conventional wisdom held that paranoia was only experienced by people with severe mental health problems and little could be done to rectify its disastrous effects. Paranoia gives us a front row seat as Freeman turns the traditional view on its head.<br/>He develops life-changing treatments for clinical paranoia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often using state-of-the-art technology like virtual reality. He reveals that suspicion is rife in society, with paranoia widespread, conspiracy theories rampant and emotion all too often trumping evidence. He discovers the causes of mistrust, including the role of genes, trauma, lack of sleep, worry, low self-confidence, cannabis use and hearing voices, and delves into the murky world of Covid-19 conspiracy theories. Lighting up the narrative throughout are the rarely heard voices of people whose lives have been almost wrecked by paranoia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then in many cases transformed by Freeman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s groundbreaking treatments.<br/>This is also a practical book. Freeman shows how we can measure our own levels of mistrust. He explains how we can remedy things if those levels are higher than we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like, because although mistrust can seem engrained, things can change for the better. Ultimately, it can be overcome.

As the modernists came of age and the traditionalists began to decline, there arose a rich variety of styles and tastes in Britain and across the empire, a variety that reflected the restless zeitgeist of the years before the Second World War. At the time of his death in 2017, Gavin Stamp, one of Britain's leading architectural critics, was at work on a deeply considered account of British architecture in the interwar period, correcting what he saw as the skewed view of earlier historians who were unable to see past modernism. Beginning with a survey of the modern movement after the armistice, INTERWAR untangles the threads that link lesser-known movements like the Egyptian revival with the enduring popularity of the Tudorbethan, to chronicle one of Britain's most dynamic architectural periods. The result is more than an architectural history - it is the portrait of a changing nation. As an account of the period that still shapes much of Britain's towns and cities, Gavin Stamp's final work is the definitive history of British architecture between the Great War and the Blitz.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9781800817401", "isbn10": "1800817401", "isbn13": "9781800817401", "language": "en", "pages": "575", "publication_year": "8/26/2025", "publisher": "IPS - Profile Books", "report_code": "", "report_date": "", "rrp": "25", "stock": "109", "title": "Interwar: British Architecture 1919-39", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "740"}, {"id": "928163", "author": "Helen Glynn Jones", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/1788193482191.jpg", "description": "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be forced to take the crown, simply because of who my parents are.

I dived straight into this clever, joyous, celebration of nature, history, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of course \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the countryside.' Charles Spencer, author of The White Ship<br/>For most of human history, we were rural folk.<br/>Our daily lives were bound up with working the land, living within the rhythm of the seasons. We poured our energies into growing food, tending to animals and watching the weather. Family, friends and neighbours were often one and the same. Life revolved around the village and its key spaces and places \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the church, the green, the school and the marketplace.<br/>And yet rural life is oddly invisible our historical records. The daily routine of the peasant, the farmer or the craftsperson could never compete with the glamour of city life, war and royal drama. Lives went unrecorded, stories untold.<br/>There is, though, one way in which we can learn about our rural past.

His ancestors were farmers and farm labourers on the northern island of Sanday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where, in 1624, one of them was murdered by a witch. In an expansive and enthralling historical account, Marshall looks afresh at a small group of islands that has been treated as a mere footnote, remote and peripheral, and in doing so invites us to think differently about key events of British history.<br/>With Orkney as our point of departure, Marshall traverses three dramatic centuries of religious, political and economic upheaval: a time when what we think of as modern Scotland, and then modern Britain, was being forged and tested.<br/>Storm's Edge is a magisterial history, a fascinating cultural study and a mighty attestation to the importance of placing the periphery at the centre. Britain is a nation composed of many different islands, but too often we focus on just one.

Written by a northern Scotland specialist who edits the award-winning JRNY Travel Magazine, this guidebook provides greater detail than any other to the whole of northern Scotland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c roaming far beyond the increasingly popular 516-mile North Coast 500 (NC500) driving route. Coupling a wide, personal selection of places to explore with focused advice on travel practicalities, Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s North Highlands (Slow Travel) encourages visitors to adopt a leisurely approach designed to tease out the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special qualities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and contribute positively to local communities.<br/><br/>In the far northern reaches of Scotland, Sutherland, Caithness and Ross-shire are regions that, by their nature, demand to be taken slowly.

Getting into wilderness is joyously easy: within moments of parking your car or stepping out of your B&B, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re striding among scenery so enchanting and dramatic it feels like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been conjured up by someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imagination. Whether you fancy clambering over rocks to discover a secret beach, watching dolphins leap, playing a round at Royal Dornoch Golf Course, kayaking to uninhabited islands or trekking to villages abandoned during the Highland Clearances (the ousted residents often resettling in the US), northern Scotland is the kind of place that gets its teeth into you.

Haunted into adulthood by her Korean father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abandonment of his family, as well as the specter of her beguiling, abusive white mother, the painter finds herself caught in a perfect trap. She wants Hanne, or wants to be her, or to sully her, or destroy her, or consume her, or some confusion of all the above. Since she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an artist, she will use art to get closer to Hanne, beginning a series of paintings with her new muse as model. As for Hanne, what does she want? Her whiteness seems sometimes as cruel as a new sheet of paper.<br/>When the paintings of Hanne become a hit, resulting in the artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sold-out show, she resolves to bring her new muse with her to Berlin, to continue their work, and her seduction. But, just when the painter is on the verge of her long sought-after breakthrough, a petition started by a Black performance artist begins making the rounds in the art community, calling for the boycott of major museums and art galleries for their imperialist and racist practices.<br/>Torn between her desire to support the petition, to be a success, and to possess Hanne, the painter and her reality become more unstable and disorienting, unwilling to cut loose any one of her warring ambitions, yet unable to accommodate them all. Is it any wonder so many artists self-destruct so spectacularly? Is it perhaps just a bit exciting to think she could too?<br/>Your Love Is Not Good stuffs queer explosive into the cracks between identity and aspiration, between desire and art, and revels in the raining debris.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9781916751224", "isbn10": "1916751229", "isbn13": "9781916751224", "language": "en", "pages": "336", "publication_year": "4/15/2025", "publisher": "And Other Stories", "report_code": "", "report_date": "", "rrp": "12.99", "stock": "97", "title": "Your Love is Not Good", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "278"}, {"id": "960550", "author": "Elizabeth Millard", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/19907043482458.jpg", "description": "Grow fresh, organic produce in your house, condo, apartment, basement, or sunny downtown office.

Campbell's full career is chronicled, from his early influences (Marc Bolan, Rory Gallagher and Gary Moore), his first semi-professional band, Sweet Savage, through to his first real musical break and success with Dio. Followed by a tumultuous breakup with Ronnie James Dio, Campbell toured with Whitesnake on the strength of their multi-platinum selling 1987 album.<br/>In 1992 Campbell started what has become his decades-long relationship with Def Leppard. Campbell's work with Lou Gramm in the band Shadow King, and his time spent with Riverdogs is also explored, all of which helps to shed light on Campbell's evolution from heavy rock 'guitar hero' to a more nuanced player who would rather serve the song with his playing than bring down the house with a 20-minute guitar solo.<br/>Campbell also created Last In Line, basically a rebirth of the Dio band minus it's frontman. In summing up, when Campbell received the Oh Yeah Legend Award in 2017, he said 'I am not used to getting awards. I am not a celebrity, the only people who know me are the hard rock fans and guitar junkies.' The 2017 award marked some belated recognition for Campbell in his hometown.

Discover also how to alter, rescue and improve a painting where you may have a problem, or decide to change a passage on a whim.

While his body became the subject of scientific scrutiny, he spoke to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading experts from academia, agriculture, and\u00e2\u20ac\u2022most important\u00e2\u20ac\u2022the food industry itself. But more than teaching him about the experience of the food, the diet switched off Chris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own addiction to UPF.<br/><br/>In a fast-paced and eye-opening narrative he explores the origins, science, and economics of UPF to reveal its catastrophic impact on our bodies and the planet.

Almost everyone in Britain lives close to a Roman road, if only we knew where to look.<br/>In the beginning was Watling Street, the first road scored on the land when the invading Romans arrived on a cold and alien Kentish shore in 43 CE. Campaign roads rolled out to all points of the compass, forcing their way inland and as the Britons fell back, the roads pursued them relentlessly, carrying troops, supplies and military despatches. In the years of fighting that followed, as the legions pushed onwards across what is now England, into Wales and north into Scotland in search of booty, mineral wealth, land and tribute, they left behind a vast road network, linking marching camps and forts, changing the landscape, etching the story of the Roman advance into the face of the land, channelling our lives today.<br/>Christopher Hadley, acclaimed author of Hollow Places, takes us on a lyrical journey into this past, retracing and searching for an elusive Roman road that sprang from one of the busiest road hubs in Roman Britain. His passage is not always easy. Time and nature have erased many clues; bridges rotted and whole woods grew across the route. Carters found an easier ford downstream, and people broke up its milestones to mend new paths. Year after year the heavy clay swallowed whole lengths of it; the once mighty road became a bridleway, an overgrown hollow-way, a parched mark in the soil.<br/>Hadley leads us on a hunt to discover, in Hilaire Belloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phrase, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall that has arisen along the way\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

Have you ever found something mysterious? Something you had no idea what it was but you had this feeling it was important, that it held a secret? Mary Anning was a fossil hunter, scouring the cliffs and seashores of Lyme Regis for strange rocks and shells. Monstrous marine reptiles and dinosaurs had once reigned the land and seas here millions of years ago, disappearing only to leave mysterious traces for humans to puzzle over. Mary's fossils paved the way for modern palaeontology and helped to piece together a picture of how the dinosaurs lived and evolved.

In this revelatory book, sociologist and public health professor Jonathan Kennedy argues that the peddlers of this myth of human exceptionalism massively overestimate the role that we play in social and political change. Instead, it is the humble microbe that wins wars and topples empires.<br/><br/>Drawing on the latest research in fields ranging from genetics and anthropology to archaeology and economics, Pathogenesis takes us through the 60,000 years of our human history, exploring eight major outbreaks of infectious disease that made the modern world. Bacteria and viruses were the protagonists in the demise of the Neanderthals, the growth of Islam, the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the devastation wrought by European colonialism, and the growth of the United States from an imperial backwater to a global superpower. Even Christianity rose to prominence on the back of a wave of deadly pandemics that swept through the Roman Empire in the second and third centuries. The members of this small group tended both their own sick and those abandoned by the Romans, saving many lives and helping turn this tiny, obscure sect into one of the world's major religions.<br/><br/>By centering disease in his wide-ranging history of humankind, Kennedy challenges some of our most fundamental assumptions about our collective past--and urges us to view our current moment as another disease-driven inflection point that will change the course of history.

To discover the truth, Jo needs to get back in with the group of classmates who have shut her out: the boys who betrayed her and the clique of girls who whisper behind her back. And she has to make it look as if she wants to be there.<br/><br/>The only way back in is through Hudson. An old fling with his own reasons for finding Maddie, he persuades Jo to fake date him. And it works. But as the truth about Maddie's disappearance comes to light, so do long-hidden secrets from Jo's past. Who is Jo really trying to find-Maddie, or the girl she herself used to be?<br/><br/>A gripping read, perfect for fans of One of Us is Lying, We Were Liars and A Good Girl's Guide to Murder.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9.78E+12", "isbn10": "1526669862", "isbn13": "9.78E+12", "language": "en", "pages": "320", "publication_year": "2024", "publisher": "Bloomsbury YA", "report_code": "", "report_date": "", "rrp": "8.99", "stock": "111", "title": "Not Like Other Girls", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "310"}, {"id": "387769", "author": "MacInnes Martin", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/20547533482842.jpg", "description": "Leigh grew up in Rotterdam, drawn to the waterfront as an escape from her unhappy home life and volatile father. Enchanted by the undersea world of her childhood, she excels in marine biology, travelling the globe to study ancient organisms. When a trench is discovered in the Atlantic ocean, Leigh joins the exploration team, hoping to find evidence of the earth's first life forms - what she instead finds calls into question everything we know about our own beginnings.<br/><br/>Her discovery leads Leigh to the Mojave desert and an ambitious new space agency. Drawn deeper into the agency's work, she learns that the Atlantic trench is only one of several related phenomena from across the world, each piece linking up to suggest a pattern beyond human understanding. Leigh knows that to continue working with the agency will mean leaving behind her declining mother and her younger sister, and faces an impossible choice: to remain with her family, or to embark on a journey across the breadth of the cosmos.<br/><br/>Exploring the natural world with the wonder and reverence we usually reserve for the stars, In Ascension is a compassionate, deeply inquisitive epic that reaches outward to confront the greatest questions of existence, looks inward to illuminate the smallest details of the human heart, and shows how - no matter how far away we might be and how much we have lost hope - we will always attempt to return to the people and places we call home.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9.78E+12", "isbn10": "1838956271", "isbn13": "9.78E+12", "language": "en", "pages": "", "publication_year": "1/27/2024", "publisher": "FABER ET FABER", "report_code": "", "report_date": "", "rrp": "9.99", "stock": "259", "title": "In Ascension", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "342"}, {"id": "387987", "author": "Rough Guides", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/21582793482842.jpg", "description": "This Japan guidebook is perfect for independent travellers planning a longer trip.

Blending in does not come easily to the women: Aila was badly burned in the fire and left with visible injuries, while her mother struggles to maintain her grip on reality. When a temporary minister is appointed in the area, rather than welcome the two women, he develops a strange curiosity for them that sets them even further apart from the community.<br/><br/>Then arrives a motley troupe of traveling entertainers from Edinburgh, led by the charismatic but mysterious Jack. It is just the distraction Janet, and particularly Aila, needs: for the first time in a long while, their lives are filling with joy and friendship, and a kind of hope Aila hasn't known since her father's death. But in this small community, faith is more powerful than truth, and whispers more dangerous even than fire.<br/><br/>Haunting and deeply moving, The Last Witch of Scotland is a story of love, loyalty and sacrifice, inspired by the true story of the last person to be executed for witchcraft in Britain.<br/><br/>Perfect for fans of Outlander and The Mercies, or for anyone with an interest in the history of witchcraft, late renaissance Scotland and Highland history.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9.78E+12", "isbn10": "1785305247", "isbn13": "9.78E+12", "language": "en", "pages": "352", "publication_year": "2024", "publisher": "Black & White Publishing", "report_code": "", "report_date": "", "rrp": "9.99", "stock": "104", "title": "The Last Witch of Scotland: A bewitching story based on true events", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "234"}, {"id": "393537", "author": "Eric Rosswood, Jodie Anders", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/23851273482787.jpg", "description": "Self-Acceptance and Identity Affirmations for LGBT+ Teens (Ages 12-18)<br/><br/>#1 New Release in Teen & Young Adult LGBTQ+ Issues, LGBTQ+ Issues, Maturing, and Civil and Human Rights<br/>A positive affirmations book with invaluable information for all queer teens<br/>Inspirational and motivational quotes and information.

There are centuries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of adoration for rolling hills and dramatic, mountainous landscapes. In contrast, flat landscapes are forgettable and seemingly unworthy of poetic or artistic attention.<br/><br/>Noreen Masud suffers from complex post-traumatic stress the product of a profoundly disrupted and unstable childhood. It flattens her emotions, blanks out parts of her memory, and colours her world with anxiety. Undertaking a pilgrimage around Britain's flatlands, seeking solace and belonging, she weaves her impressions of the natural world with poetry, folklore and history, and with recollections of her own early life.<br/><br/>Masud's British-Pakistani heritage makes her a partial outsider in these both coloniser and colonised, inheritor and dispossessed. Here violence lies beneath the fantasy of pastoral innocence, and histories of harm are interwoven with nature's power to heal. Here, as in her own family history, are many stories that resist the telling. She pursues these paradoxes fearlessly across the flat, haunted spaces she loves, offering a startlingly strange, vivid and intimate account of the land beneath her feet.<br/><br/>Masud combines memoir, nature writing, and literary reflection to explore what can be drawn from these powerful places, and to understand her own experience of complex trauma and post-traumatic stress, as well as grief and loss.

More people than ever are having that penny-drop revelation that ADHD might explain what has made life so difficult for them, but NHS waiting times for referrals are running into years, and thousands are not getting the help they desperately need.<br/><br/>It doesn't need to be this way. Dr James Kustow, one of the UK's leading adult ADHD psychiatrists, knows first-hand that medical assistance is just one part of overcoming the challenges associated with ADHD. With the right lifestyle adjustments, nutritional changes and mental attitude, and by integrating simple organisational systems and stabilising routines, adult ADHD can become a strength, capitalising on the creativity and passion that those with ADHD so often exhibit. He knows this professionally but also personally, as he himself is managing ADHD day to day - diagnosed in adulthood.<br/><br/>In this no-nonsense guide, Dr Kustow will demystify ADHD and share seven key pillars for managing and harnessing its powers, based on cutting-edge research and 20 years of clinical experience that has shown him how these tools radically transform lives.<br/><br/>Each pillar involves incremental changes - to your lifestyle, diet and mindset - and targeted strategies to optimise time and task management.

These two works show us his remarkable creative brilliance at the start and at the end of a highly productive writing life.<br/>Thomas described Under Milk Wood variously as 'a play, an impression for voices, an entertainment out of the darkness'. It had its most famous incarnation as a radio play, broadcast in 1954, only months after its author's death. This is the text used for that broadcast. Full of the comedy of human existence, it also strikes notes of poignancy and loss as we travel through twenty-four hours in the company of those who inhabit the 'multifariously busy little town'. It is an affectionate vision of the 'drinks and loves and quarrels and dreams and wishes' of people very much like ourselves.

What if that double shared many of your preoccupations but, in a twisted, upside-down way, furthered the very causes you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d devoted your life to fighting against?<br/><br/>Not long ago, the celebrated activist and public intellectual Naomi Klein had just such an experience\u00e2\u20ac\u2022she was confronted with a doppelganger whose views she found abhorrent but whose name and public persona were sufficiently similar to her own that many people got confused about who was who. Destabilized, she lost her bearings, until she began to understand the experience as one manifestation of a strangeness many of us have come to know but struggle to define: AI-generated text is blurring the line between genuine and spurious communication; New Age wellness entrepreneurs turned anti-vaxxers are scrambling familiar political allegiances of left and right; and liberal democracies are teetering on the edge of absurdist authoritarianism, even as the oceans rise. Under such conditions, reality itself seems to have become unmoored. Is there a cure for our moment of collective vertigo?<br/><br/>Naomi Klein is one of our most trenchant and influential social critics, an essential analyst of what branding, austerity, and climate profiteering have done to our societies and souls. Here she turns her gaze inward to our psychic landscapes, and outward to the possibilities for building hope amid intersecting economic, medical, and political crises. With the assistance of Sigmund Freud, Jordan Peele, Alfred Hitchcock, and bell hooks, among other accomplices, Klein uses wry humor and a keen sense of the ridiculous to face the strange doubles that haunt us\u00e2\u20ac\u2022and that have come to feel as intimate and proximate as a warped reflection in the mirror.<br/><br/>Combining comic memoir with chilling reportage and cobweb-clearing analysis, Klein seeks to smash that mirror and chart a path beyond despair. Doppelganger What do we neglect as we polish and perfect our digital reflections? Is it possible to dispose of our doubles and overcome the pathologies of a culture of multiplication? Can we create a politics of collective care and undertake a true reckoning with historical crimes?

We see Burton emerging from the mists and brimstone of Wales to be the greatest theatrical animal of his generation. The pair come together in Rome during the making of Cleopatra, which gives Lewis the opportunity for a major farcical set-piece. We then enter a world of jewels and private jets, vodka, yachts and furs - the splendid vulgarity of the Sixties, where the narrative of Taylor and Burton becomes a Pop Art story.<br/><br/>Then, inevitably, it all goes wrong, with alcoholism, violence, recrimination and divorce ( twice ) - with Burton, whom Lewis depicts as a Faustus figure, damned by fame, dead at fifty-eight.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry has said, 'It is one of the very best biographies I have ever read.

It consists of six core sections ('In the Studio', 'On the Stage 1985-1991', 'Introducing the New Rory Gallagher Band', 'On the Stage 1992-1995', 'Ireland', 'Rory in the 21st Century') in which eighteen chapters are grouped together; however, each chapter can be read independently. Although the book's focus is squarely on 1985 to 1995, occasionally it also encompasses important earlier achievements in the 1980s that have been overlooked in previous works on Gallagher. Section 1 looks at Gallagher's three final studio albums: Jinx (1982), Defender (1987) and Fresh Evidence (1990). It also covers his session work and collaborations between 1985 to 1995. Section 2 covers the period when Gerry McAvoy and Brendan O'Neill were members of the Rory Gallagher Band. It recounts Gallagher's tours of Hungary and Yugoslavia (1985), Spain (1986) and the United States, Australia and Japan (1991), as well as headlining performances at major European festivals. Section 3 provides the first full account of Gallagher's final band members (Richard Newman, David Levy, and Mark Feltham), as well as occasional guests. Section 4 tackles the last four years of Gallagher's touring history including The Bonn Blues Festival (1992), the Montreux Jazz Festival (1994) and the final tour of 1995. Section 5 is dedicated to his many musical achievements in his homeland, including his \"comeback\" show at the Cork Opera House in 1987, his 1988 Irish Tour and his involvement with major Irish events and festivals, such as Lisdoonvarna (1983), Self Aid (1986) and Rock on the Lough (1989). Also the Temple Bar Blues Festival (1992)-one of Gallagher's crowning achievements-and a number of important 1992-1993 shows in Cork, including Lark by the Lee, Everyman's Theatre and the Regional Technical College Arts Festival.

I am familiar with all your ways (Ps. 139:3)\u00e2\u20ac\u2022even the very hairs on your head are numbered (Matt. 10:29\u00e2\u20ac\u201c31).<br/>You were made in my image (Gen. 1:27). In me you live and move and have your being, for you are my offspring (Acts 17:28). I knew you even before you were conceived (Jer. 1:4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5). I chose you when I planned creation (Eph. 1:11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12). You were not a mistake, for all your days are written in my book (Ps. 139:15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16). I determined the exact time of your birth and where you would live (Acts 17:26). You are fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps. 139:14). I knit you together in your mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s womb (Ps. 139:13), and brought you forth on the day you were born (Ps. 71:6).<br/>I have been misrepresented by those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know me (John 8:41\u00e2\u20ac\u201c44). I am not distant and angry, but am the complete expression of love (1 John 4:16). And it is my desire to lavish my love on you, simply because you are my child and I am your Father (1 John 3:1). I offer you more than your earthly father ever could (Matt. 7:11), for I am the perfect Father (Matt. 5:48). Every good gift that you receive comes from my hand (James 1:17), for I am your provider and I meet all your needs (Matt. 6:31\u00e2\u20ac\u201c33).<br/>My plan for your future has always been filled with hope (Jer. 29:11), because I love you with an everlasting love (Jer. 31:3). My thoughts toward you are as countless as the sand on the seashore (Ps. 139:17\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18), and I rejoice over you with singing (Zeph. 3:17). I will never stop doing good to you (Jer. 32:40), for you are my treasured possession (Ex. 19:5).<br/>I desire to establish you with all my heart and all my soul (Jer. 32:41), and I want to show you great and marvelous things (Jer. 33:3). If you seek me with all your heart, you will find me (Deut. 4:29); delight in me and I will give you the desires of your heart (Ps. 37:4), for it is I who gave you those desires (Phil. 2:13).<br/>I am able to do more for you than you could possibly imagine (Eph. 3:20), for I am your greatest encourager (2 Thess. 2:16\u00e2\u20ac\u201c17). I am also the Father who comforts you in all your troubles (2 Cor. 1:3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4). When you are brokenhearted, I am close to you (Ps. 34:18); as a shepherd carries a lamb, I have carried you close to my heart (Isa. 40:11). One day I will wipe away every tear from your eyes, and I will take away all the pain you have suffered on this earth (Rev. 21:3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4).<br/>I am your Father, and I love you even as I love my Son, Jesus (John 17:23). In him, my love for you is revealed (John 17:26). He is the exact representation of my being (Heb. 1:3). He came to demonstrate that I am for you, not against you (Rom. 8:31), and to tell you that I am not counting your sins against you. Jesus died so that you and I could be reconciled (2 Cor. 5:18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c19). His death was the ultimate expression of my love for you (1 John 4:10): I gave up everything I loved that I might gain your love (Rom. 8:31\u00e2\u20ac\u201c32).<br/>If you receive the gift of my Son, Jesus, you receive me (1 John 2:23), and nothing will ever separate you from my love again (Rom. 8:38\u00e2\u20ac\u201c39).

Swimming in their own stream, the Banshees defy musical categorisation and are head and shoulders above their peers, with one objective: to be the best band in the world. The band's 1981 90-gig tour included 25 dates in the US, showcasing the exhilarating 'Spellbound', grotesque 'Night Shift' and the clandestine frisson of 'Into The Light', forming the sonic backbone of what is considered to be the Banshees' magnum opus, Juju, their fourth studio album, released in June 1981. Ushering in a new chapter in Siouxsie and The Banshees' evolution the opulent fifth studio album A Kiss In The Dreamhouse, marks another change in direction, and sees producer Mike Hedges superseding Kaleidoscope and Juju producer Nigel Gray. Released 5th November 1982, several days after guitarist John McGeoch is ousted from the band after two near calamitous performances at the Rock-Ola Club in Madrid, it was the album that marked a potential dip in the band's fortunes. However the Banshees regroup, calling again on the services of The Cure's Robert Smith, whose fractured relationship with his own band made the offer of becoming a touring Banshee too attractive to refuse. As for what happens next, this in-depth and authoritative account of one of the most original, creative, imaginative and mercurial bands in the history of rock music surveys the twists, turns and episodes of brilliance that define Siouxsie and The Banshees' evolution from 1980 to 1987, including ancillary ventures 'The Creatures' and 'The Glove', and the making of the albums Juju and A Kiss In The Dreamhouse, as well as Nocturne, Hyaena, Tinderbox and Through The Looking Glass.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9.78E+12", "isbn10": "191524658X", "isbn13": "9.78E+12", "language": "en", "pages": "298", "publication_year": "9/20/2024", "publisher": "Wymer UK", "report_code": "POS", "report_date": "", "rrp": "16.99", "stock": "91", "title": "Into The Light: Siouxsie And The Banshees 1980-1987", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "460"}, {"id": "472219", "author": "Lonely Planet", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/17967003482842.jpg", "description": "Lonely Planet's Korea is our most comprehensive guide that extensively covers all the country has to offer, with recommendations for both popular and lesser-known experiences.

Almost everyone in Britain lives close to a Roman road, if only we knew where to look.<br/>In the beginning was Watling Street, the first road scored on the land when the invading Romans arrived on a cold and alien Kentish shore in 43 CE. Campaign roads rolled out to all points of the compass, forcing their way inland and as the Britons fell back, the roads pursued them relentlessly, carrying troops, supplies and military despatches. In the years of fighting that followed, as the legions pushed onwards across what is now England, into Wales and north into Scotland in search of booty, mineral wealth, land and tribute, they left behind a vast road network, linking marching camps and forts, changing the landscape, etching the story of the Roman advance into the face of the land, channelling our lives today.<br/>Christopher Hadley, acclaimed author of Hollow Places, takes us on a lyrical journey into this past, retracing and searching for an elusive Roman road that sprang from one of the busiest road hubs in Roman Britain. His passage is not always easy. Time and nature have erased many clues; bridges rotted and whole woods grew across the route. Carters found an easier ford downstream, and people broke up its milestones to mend new paths. Year after year the heavy clay swallowed whole lengths of it; the once mighty road became a bridleway, an overgrown hollow-way, a parched mark in the soil.<br/>Hadley leads us on a hunt to discover, in Hilaire Belloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phrase, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall that has arisen along the way\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

Mary Anning was a fossil hunter, scouring the cliffs and seashores of Lyme Regis for strange rocks and shells. Monstrous marine reptiles and dinosaurs had once reigned the land and seas here millions of years ago, disappearing only to leave mysterious traces for humans to puzzle over. Mary's fossils paved the way for modern palaeontology and helped to piece together a picture of how the dinosaurs lived and evolved.

Instead, it is the humble microbe that wins wars and topples empires.<br/><br/>Drawing on the latest research in fields ranging from genetics and anthropology to archaeology and economics, Pathogenesis takes us through the 60,000 years of our human history, exploring eight major outbreaks of infectious disease that made the modern world. Bacteria and viruses were the protagonists in the demise of the Neanderthals, the growth of Islam, the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the devastation wrought by European colonialism, and the growth of the United States from an imperial backwater to a global superpower. Even Christianity rose to prominence on the back of a wave of deadly pandemics that swept through the Roman Empire in the second and third centuries. The members of this small group tended both their own sick and those abandoned by the Romans, saving many lives and helping turn this tiny, obscure sect into one of the world's major religions.<br/><br/>By centering disease in his wide-ranging history of humankind, Kennedy challenges some of our most fundamental assumptions about our collective past--and urges us to view our current moment as another disease-driven inflection point that will change the course of history.

Blending in does not come easily to the women: Aila was badly burned in the fire and left with visible injuries, while her mother struggles to maintain her grip on reality. When a temporary minister is appointed in the area, rather than welcome the two women, he develops a strange curiosity for them that sets them even further apart from the community.<br/><br/>Then arrives a motley troupe of traveling entertainers from Edinburgh, led by the charismatic but mysterious Jack. It is just the distraction Janet, and particularly Aila, needs: for the first time in a long while, their lives are filling with joy and friendship, and a kind of hope Aila hasn't known since her father's death.

Full of the comedy of human existence, it also strikes notes of poignancy and loss as we travel through twenty-four hours in the company of those who inhabit the 'multifariously busy little town'.

What if that double shared many of your preoccupations but, in a twisted, upside-down way, furthered the very causes you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d devoted your life to fighting against?<br/><br/>Not long ago, the celebrated activist and public intellectual Naomi Klein had just such an experience\u00e2\u20ac\u2022she was confronted with a doppelganger whose views she found abhorrent but whose name and public persona were sufficiently similar to her own that many people got confused about who was who. Destabilized, she lost her bearings, until she began to understand the experience as one manifestation of a strangeness many of us have come to know but struggle to define: AI-generated text is blurring the line between genuine and spurious communication; New Age wellness entrepreneurs turned anti-vaxxers are scrambling familiar political allegiances of left and right; and liberal democracies are teetering on the edge of absurdist authoritarianism, even as the oceans rise. Under such conditions, reality itself seems to have become unmoored. Is there a cure for our moment of collective vertigo?<br/><br/>Naomi Klein is one of our most trenchant and influential social critics, an essential analyst of what branding, austerity, and climate profiteering have done to our societies and souls. Here she turns her gaze inward to our psychic landscapes, and outward to the possibilities for building hope amid intersecting economic, medical, and political crises. With the assistance of Sigmund Freud, Jordan Peele, Alfred Hitchcock, and bell hooks, among other accomplices, Klein uses wry humor and a keen sense of the ridiculous to face the strange doubles that haunt us\u00e2\u20ac\u2022and that have come to feel as intimate and proximate as a warped reflection in the mirror.<br/><br/>Combining comic memoir with chilling reportage and cobweb-clearing analysis, Klein seeks to smash that mirror and chart a path beyond despair. Doppelganger What do we neglect as we polish and perfect our digital reflections? Is it possible to dispose of our doubles and overcome the pathologies of a culture of multiplication? Can we create a politics of collective care and undertake a true reckoning with historical crimes?

Ronnie is the first to say he doesn't have all the answers, but in sharing the experiences that have shaped him and mistakes that have made him, he hopes to help readers navigate their own personal challenges and obstacles, and in turn reach their maximum potential.<br/><br/>This is Ronnie O'Sullivan as you've never seen him before, the definitive and unflinching story of a true British icon and a fascinating insight into the mindset of the world's greatest snooker player.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9.78E+12", "isbn10": "1399610031", "isbn13": "9.78E+12", "language": "en", "pages": "272", "publication_year": "2024", "publisher": "Seven Dials", "report_code": "", "report_date": "", "rrp": "9.99", "stock": "101", "title": "Unbreakable", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "250"}, {"id": "915714", "author": "Johanna", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/9455973482686.jpg", "description": "London, October 1940.

We see Burton emerging from the mists and brimstone of Wales to be the greatest theatrical animal of his generation. The pair come together in Rome during the making of Cleopatra, which gives Lewis the opportunity for a major farcical set-piece. We then enter a world of jewels and private jets, vodka, yachts and furs - the splendid vulgarity of the Sixties, where the narrative of Taylor and Burton becomes a Pop Art story.<br/><br/>Then, inevitably, it all goes wrong, with alcoholism, violence, recrimination and divorce ( twice ) - with Burton, whom Lewis depicts as a Faustus figure, damned by fame, dead at fifty-eight.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry has said, 'It is one of the very best biographies I have ever read.

It consists of six core sections ('In the Studio', 'On the Stage 1985-1991', 'Introducing the New Rory Gallagher Band', 'On the Stage 1992-1995', 'Ireland', 'Rory in the 21st Century') in which eighteen chapters are grouped together; however, each chapter can be read independently. Although the book's focus is squarely on 1985 to 1995, occasionally it also encompasses important earlier achievements in the 1980s that have been overlooked in previous works on Gallagher. Section 1 looks at Gallagher's three final studio albums: Jinx (1982), Defender (1987) and Fresh Evidence (1990). It also covers his session work and collaborations between 1985 to 1995. Section 2 covers the period when Gerry McAvoy and Brendan O'Neill were members of the Rory Gallagher Band. It recounts Gallagher's tours of Hungary and Yugoslavia (1985), Spain (1986) and the United States, Australia and Japan (1991), as well as headlining performances at major European festivals. Section 3 provides the first full account of Gallagher's final band members (Richard Newman, David Levy, and Mark Feltham), as well as occasional guests. Section 4 tackles the last four years of Gallagher's touring history including The Bonn Blues Festival (1992), the Montreux Jazz Festival (1994) and the final tour of 1995. Section 5 is dedicated to his many musical achievements in his homeland, including his \"comeback\" show at the Cork Opera House in 1987, his 1988 Irish Tour and his involvement with major Irish events and festivals, such as Lisdoonvarna (1983), Self Aid (1986) and Rock on the Lough (1989). Also the Temple Bar Blues Festival (1992)-one of Gallagher's crowning achievements-and a number of important 1992-1993 shows in Cork, including Lark by the Lee, Everyman's Theatre and the Regional Technical College Arts Festival. The book concludes with an epilogue reflecting upon Gallagher's legacy in the 21st century, particularly amongst a new generation of fans.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9.78E+12", "isbn10": "1915246601", "isbn13": "9.78E+12", "language": "en", "pages": "442", "publication_year": "10/4/2024", "publisher": "Wymer UK", "report_code": "POS", "report_date": "", "rrp": "19.99", "stock": "140", "title": "Rory Gallagher - The Later Years", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "678"}, {"id": "937296", "author": "Jay Zigmont PhD MBA CFP\u00c2\u00ae", "binding": "Paperback", "cover_image": "https://images.isbndb.com/covers/9304103482803.jpg", "description": "An essential and comprehensive personal finance and money management guide for Childfree and Permanently Childless people.<br/>Design the life you want, then create the right financial plan to get you there.<br/>Financial planning looks vastly different for DINKs (dual-income, no kids) and SINKs (single-income, no kids).

The band's 1981 90-gig tour included 25 dates in the US, showcasing the exhilarating 'Spellbound', grotesque 'Night Shift' and the clandestine frisson of 'Into The Light', forming the sonic backbone of what is considered to be the Banshees' magnum opus, Juju, their fourth studio album, released in June 1981. Ushering in a new chapter in Siouxsie and The Banshees' evolution the opulent fifth studio album A Kiss In The Dreamhouse, marks another change in direction, and sees producer Mike Hedges superseding Kaleidoscope and Juju producer Nigel Gray. Released 5th November 1982, several days after guitarist John McGeoch is ousted from the band after two near calamitous performances at the Rock-Ola Club in Madrid, it was the album that marked a potential dip in the band's fortunes. However the Banshees regroup, calling again on the services of The Cure's Robert Smith, whose fractured relationship with his own band made the offer of becoming a touring Banshee too attractive to refuse. As for what happens next, this in-depth and authoritative account of one of the most original, creative, imaginative and mercurial bands in the history of rock music surveys the twists, turns and episodes of brilliance that define Siouxsie and The Banshees' evolution from 1980 to 1987, including ancillary ventures 'The Creatures' and 'The Glove', and the making of the albums Juju and A Kiss In The Dreamhouse, as well as Nocturne, Hyaena, Tinderbox and Through The Looking Glass.", "discount": "45", "ean": "9.78E+12", "isbn10": "191524658X", "isbn13": "9.78E+12", "language": "en", "pages": "298", "publication_year": "9/20/2024", "publisher": "Wymer UK", "report_code": "POS", "report_date": "", "rrp": "16.99", "stock": "91", "title": "Into The Light: Siouxsie And The Banshees 1980-1987", "vat_code": "Z", "weight": "460"}]]
